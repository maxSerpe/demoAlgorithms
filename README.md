# Practice Algorithms
This is a storage space for quick algorithms I've written for technical interview practice, provided by LeetCode. 
My intention for putting them on github is so that I can reinforce good coding habbits, such as:
- Linting 
- Writing Test Cases
- A given, but version control
- Package Imports
Secondary intentions include building a larger index of code I have written, as well as backing up this work in case it is ever lost on LeetCode
