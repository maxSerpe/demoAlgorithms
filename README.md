# Demo Algorithms
Repository for algorithms I've written during technical interview practice, provided by LeetCode. 
Intentions while writing include: 
- Optimizing for speed, memory, then speed and memory, in that order
- Comparing my solutions against other LeetCode user's submissions 
- Providing testing framework for algirthms I write, as well as linting 
- A given, but version control

Here is an example of one of my successful implimentations, both for speed and memory:
